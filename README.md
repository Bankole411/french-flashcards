# Description:

The French Vocabulary Flashcard Game is a Python application built using the tkinter module, designed to help users learn and improve their French language skills through interactive flashcards. The application provides a user-friendly interface for practicing French words, their English translations, and tracking progress. It utilizes a prepared database of French words and their English translations, which users can review and test their knowledge on.

# Project components

Flashcards: The application displays French words on a canvas, and after 3 seconds their English translations.
User Interaction: Users can interact with the flashcards by clicking two buttons: 'Right' and 'Wrong'
Progress Tracking: When a user clicks the 'Right' button, the word is removed from the database, simulating successful learning, and the database is updated to reflect progress.
Local Storage: User progress is saved locally on the computer, allowing users to continue their learning journey where they left off.
Pandas Framework: The pandas framework is used to manage the database of French words and their translations efficiently.
